# FIDUNIO authenticated iPhone native simulator results

**FAIL — 12 passed, 1 failed, 1 blocked**

- Installed app: disposable native debug binary built from ios release source
- Local Firebase: Auth, Firestore with original rules, Storage — demo-fidunio-simulator-tests ONLY
- Backend exception: enrollRecoveryV1 uses a localhost implementation of the repository recovery wrapper; production Cloud Functions are NOT validated.
- Native UI operations are genuine app control gestures via OS WebView inspector; database assertions read the emulator, not production.
- No ADM, APNs, FCM provider delivery, physical biometrics, real camera, or peer-device decryption is claimed.

## Functional results

### N01 — PASS: Accept legal Terms and open actual Join form

Observed on native device

### N02 — PASS: Consume a real single-use admin invite, set PIN, create E2EE identity through native Join

Admin invitation accepted; real Auth profile and account E2EE identity created in local Firebase (iPhone volatile key-cache workaround used)

### N03 — PASS: Change actual native Settings: A++, Dark, and preview option

On-device Settings widgets changed and rendered selected values

### N04 — PASS: Admin creates a new user invitation from native Settings

Admin UI created an authentic single-use invitation in local Firestore

### N05 — PASS: Start a native direct conversation with Bob

Observed on native device

### N06 — PASS: Send encrypted direct text and confirm NO plaintext in emulator

Native composer sent an encrypted message with no plaintext in Firestore

### N07 — PASS: Set disappearing timer in real native direct conversation

Actual per-conversation disappearing selector changed to 300 seconds

### N08 — PASS: React with an emoji to an accepted direct message

Native message action displayed and applied emoji reaction

### N09 — PASS: Create group from native app and verify admin controls

Real group creation and group-admin rename/add/remove controls visible in native app

### N10 — PASS: Send a native group message and verify encrypted group record

Actual native group composer wrote encrypted content to local Firestore

### N11 — PASS: Use native group administrator to add a member

Native Group Info added Owner account as a new member; Firestore membership confirmed

### N12 — PASS: Show native notification configuration controls (delivery requires real devices)

Notification UI exists and renders. Actual ADM/APNs push reception NOT tested

### N13 — FAIL: Block and unblock a native user in Safety settings
